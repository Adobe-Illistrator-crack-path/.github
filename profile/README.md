1. Vector-Based Design
Illustrator is a vector graphics editor, which means it uses paths (rather than pixels) to create images. This makes designs infinitely scalable without losing quality, ideal for logos, illustrations, and print materials.
2. Artboards
You can create multiple artboards within a single document, allowing you to work on several pieces at once, such as variations of a logo or different pages of a project.
3. Tools & Brushes
Illustrator offers a wide array of drawing tools (Pen Tool, Pencil Tool, Shape Tool, etc.) and customizable brushes for creating precise shapes and intricate designs.
4. Typography
It has advanced text and typography tools, including OpenType font support, text on a path, and the ability to convert text into paths for further manipulation.
5. Pen Tool and Paths
The Pen Tool is one of Illustratorâ€™s most powerful features, allowing users to create and edit paths with precision. Paths are key to vector design, enabling users to create smooth, editable lines and shapes.
6. Gradient and Color Tools
Illustrator has an advanced color palette, gradient tool, and swatches, enabling precise control over color blending and gradients. You can use Pantone colors or create custom blends for your designs.
7. Shapes and Pathfinder Tools
You can easily combine, subtract, and manipulate geometric shapes using the Pathfinder tool, a set of shape operations that simplifies complex design tasks.
8. Creative Cloud Integration
As part of Adobe Creative Cloud, Illustrator CC allows users to access cloud storage, share assets across other Adobe apps, and sync settings across devices.
9. Live Trace and Image Trace
Illustrator's Image Trace feature allows you to convert raster images (e.g., photographs) into editable vector artwork, making it easy to transform sketches or other images into scalable graphics.
10. 3D Effects
Illustrator CC includes basic 3D effects for extruding shapes, rotating them, and applying perspective to designs, offering more dimensionality for certain projects.
11. Collaboration & Sharing
With Illustrator CC, you can easily share and collaborate with other designers using cloud-based file sharing, and export designs in various formats (SVG, PNG, PDF, etc.).
12. Plugins and Extensions
Adobe Illustrator CC supports third-party plugins and extensions, expanding its functionality for specific industries or creative needs, such as web design or printing.
13. Compatibility
Illustrator supports both Mac and Windows platforms, and it can open and export files in a variety of formats, including .AI, .EPS, .PDF, .SVG, .PNG, and .JPG.
